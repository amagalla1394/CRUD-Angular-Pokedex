# CRUD-Angular-Pokedex
Basic practice application for Pokedex display

This project is for simple Angular practice regarding Components.

Feel free to take this and enhance it however you may like.
I simply created an application to display the list of pokemon and their basic element types.

Practice by adding the components to Add, Update and Delete.
